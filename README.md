# Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile Starter Template
A starter template for a kotlin multiplatform mobile project.

It improves the "New Project" wizard with the following:
  
  - `Dependencies.kt` file to make it easier to manage your dependencies across all modules
  - Latest Jetpack compose for Android
  - SqlDelight boilerplate (the `DriverFactory` pattern from their docos)
  
Run `./starter-setup.main.kts` to change the project name and the root package for all files.
